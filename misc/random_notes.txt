technologies --
So let's look at some of the technologies
that you'll be working with and learning in this course.
So we'll be using VS Code for our text editor,
along with a few extensions that'll show you.
Everything is modern JavaScript, so ES6+,
arrow functions, destructuring, promises, all that stuff.
We'll be using Async/Await
on both the front end and the back end.
We'll be using strictly functional components
with React Hooks on the client.
We'll be using Redux for state management,
along with the Redux Dev Tools.
For authentication, we're gonna be using JWT,
or JSON Web Tokens,
and we'll build some custom middleware to handle that.
We'll also be using Postman to make requests to our API
to test our endpoints.
We'll be using MongoDB for our database with MongoDB Atlas,
which allows us to host it in the cloud.
And we'll be using Mongoose as a database abstraction layer.
And then for our password encryption, we'll use Bcrypt.
And then finally, we're gonna deploy to Heroku using Git.
So these are some of the technologies
that you can expect to learn.
