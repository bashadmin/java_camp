technologies --
So let's look at some of the technologies
that you'll be working with and learning in this course.
So we'll be using VS Code for our text editor,
along with a few extensions that'll show you.
Everything is modern JavaScript, so ES6+,
arrow functions, destructuring, promises, all that stuff.
We'll be using Async/Await
on both the front end and the back end.
We'll be using strictly functional components
with React Hooks on the client.
We'll be using Redux for state management,
along with the Redux Dev Tools.
For authentication, we're gonna be using JWT,
or JSON Web Tokens,
and we'll build some custom middleware to handle that.
We'll also be using Postman to make requests to our API
to test our endpoints.
We'll be using MongoDB for our database with MongoDB Atlas,
which allows us to host it in the cloud.
And we'll be using Mongoose as a database abstraction layer.
And then for our password encryption, we'll use Bcrypt.
And then finally, we're gonna deploy to Heroku using Git.
So these are some of the technologies
that you can expect to learn.

HTTP Essentials
Postman Client
RESTful APIs
Express Framework
Routing & Controller Methods
MongoDB Atlas & Compass
Mongoose ODM
Advanced Query (Pagination, filter, etc)
Models & Relationships
Middleware (Express & Mongoose)
MongoDB Geospatial Index / GeoJSON
Geocoding
Custom Error Handling
User Roles & Permissions
Aggregation
Photo Upload
Authentication With JWT & Cookies
Emailing Password Reset Tokens
Custom Database Seeder Using JSON Files
Password & Token Hashing
Security: NoSQL Injection, XSS, etc
Creating Documentation
Deployment With PM2, NGINX, SSL



We also can output information using System.out.print(). Notice that we’re using print(), not println(). Unlike System.out.println(), this type of print statement outputs everything on the same line. For example:

```
System.out.print("Hello ");
System.out.print("World");
```

The above code will have the following output:

```
Hello World
```
In this example, if you were to use `print()` or `println()` again, the new text will print immediately after World on the same line. It’s important to remember where you left your program’s “cursor”. If you use `println()` the cursor is moved to the next line. If you use `print()` the cursor stays on the same line.
